Please perform a comprehensive comparison between the original TypeScript claude-powerline implementation and the new Rust implementation. 

I need you to:

1. **Find ALL missing features** from the original TypeScript that are not implemented in Rust
2. **Focus especially on CLI options and configuration features** like the "strip path" option the user mentioned
3. **Compare the command-line interface** - what options did the TypeScript version have that Rust doesn't?
4. **Compare the display logic and formatting options** 
5. **Compare configuration mechanisms** 
6. **Look for any behavioral differences** in how segments are calculated or displayed

The user specifically asked about a "strip path" option from the original TypeScript code - please identify this and any other missing CLI options or features.

Please provide:
- A detailed list of missing features
- Specific code examples from TypeScript showing these features
- Recommendations for what should be implemented in Rust

The original TypeScript code is now available in the claude-powerline/ directory, and the Rust code is in src/.
